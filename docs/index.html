<p>I created this tool to help me take notes faster. I knew I wanted to take notes as plain text files written with Markdown. I didn't want to lock my notes into a proprietary format such as OneNote or Evernote. I had tried that before and while those tools are feature rich I don't like the idea of being locked into those echo systems. Using plain text files and Markdown allows me to use a large number of editing tools and to store my notes where ever and however I want.</p>
