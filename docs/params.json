I didn't want to lock my notes into a proprietary format such as OneNote or Evernote. I had tried that before and while those tools are feature rich I don't like the idea of being locked into those echo systems. Using plain text files and Markdown allows me to use a large number of editing tools and to store my notes where ever and however I want.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nCurrently the only contributor is me, AJ Michels (@ajmichels). I have been working in software development for over a decade now in a variety of industries.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nIf you are having trouble using this tool or would like to request a feature please submit an issue to the projects [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/ajmichels/note-script/issues).\r\n",
